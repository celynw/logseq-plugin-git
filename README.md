Logseq Git Plugin is a plugin for Logseq that provides easy access to common git commands, and helps you keep your notes synchronized with a remote git repository.

With this plugin, you can:

- Know explicitly if there are unsaved notes in the current repository and if they are synchronized with the remote repository. When there are unsaved files locally, the plugin will show a red indicator in the toolbar icon.
- Quickly commit changes to notes. The plugin provides shortcut keys (mod+s) to perform commit&push operations.
- Provide buttons to quickly execute common commands. Click the plugin icon, and the drop-down menu will show you some buttons to help you quickly execute commands (you can specify the desired buttons in the settings).
- Prompt you if you have synchronized with the remote repository. The plugin automatically detects if the current repository is up-to-date and prompts when logseq starts and other times.
